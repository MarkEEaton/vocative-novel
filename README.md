# A novel in the vocative case (for Nanogenmo 2021)

When I was studying Sanskrit in college, I was really taken by the vocative case. I think that the vocative case is partly what gives Sanskrit its unique feel when it is translated to English. This is probably because sentences with vocative elements don’t really have an exact equivalent in English, which makes them stand out as being a bit unusual in a translated text. Anyhow, I think they make for wonderful reading.

After Sanskrit class, in the pub, I would joke with my classmate that I was going to write a novel in the vocative case. Fast forward to Nanogenmo many years later, and now I have my chance! I can download the entire Mahabharata, pull out all the sentences with vocative elements, and mash them together into one text. That’s what I’ve done for this Nanogenmo entry.

This is my second Nanogenmo entry for 2021. You can see my other entry [here](https://github.com/MarkEEaton/nanogenmo2021).
